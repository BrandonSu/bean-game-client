# Bean Game
A digital version of the game Bohnanza built with Node.js and Phaser 3. 
Please don't sue me I just love your game so much. 

The repo contains both the server and the client. The client was created using the [Phaser 3 Project Template](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-project-template.git).

## Instalation
On home directory, run `npm install`. Then, `cd client` and run `npm install` as well.

## Running the project
On home directory run `npm start`. The server is now running on http://localhost:2000  
On a new window, `cd client` and run `npm start`. You can now access the client on http://localhost:8080
